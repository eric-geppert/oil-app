questions:

- What if you need to make an update to previous transactions or properties etc? Are all of those allowed?
- - ask how division order can "change ownership" when the krmrs are the owners? is it operators? or just the other partners?
    - I guess its the people leasing from you
    - so we need to create a leases table?

----4/10

- what fields should accounts table have in each account?

-----5/8/25 \*\*\*\*

- so each transaction has an "account" hooked up to it?-> yes
- then does each transaction have the gross,taxes, etc or do you put each of those in separately?-> put them in separately
- \*\* should this be where you put in your ownership percentage? right now have that set in other table with dates, then you just get a single check from them and we don't need to take out percentages from there?

  - I guess the oil company paying only sends you your percentage to begin with so Need to have 2 separate paths here 1. oil company payer 2. owner (receiver)

- (5/9) can you give me some examples of accounts your paying to?
- when do you submit an entry? where can you see it after that?

5/12 answers:

- when you setup an account you give it a balance
  1000: (cash) initial balance 10,000

every account has negative or positive balance

10k from golf oil
10k in cash account as +
-10k in accout number 4000 (income accounts) from oil company that paid you

income statement influenced by that credit

next steps:

- iron out view trend
  income statement

5/15:

- is there any other place you should be able to see posted transactions? or they only show in reports after that?

  - I thought you said you could edit them still if they weren't in a submited year possibly????
    ask mom about initial setup?

- does someone walk through it with you?
- it defaults with some values?
- you can or can NOT go back once you've finished setting up?

- when we implement that different companies in the very top left:
  - would they want to have the users above the companies or have each company have a list of users? (currently you have access to 3 companies, did you have to set yourself up as a user in each one initially?)
