- restyling of front end to put the tabs on the left (cursor did it), added front end code for the accounts
- made main nav drawer on the left collapsable
- removed company from and company_to in transactions just made it company, updated api endpoints, server, and fe code"
- updated from using gross, net, taxed amount to single amount in backend, added entries table and FE code, put transactions inside of that
- added back properties tab, and fixed it to use location object instead of address string(can change this later if we want
