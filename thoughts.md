honestly pretty happy working on this. I really beleive in the product

advantages

- has great lock in and low churn
- competition is super expensive with lots of overhead they have to pay for that I don't
- I can start small with only m as a client then add one over time
- have huge advantage with m as a cpa telling me what it needs
- then being a basically guarenteed first user
- with hopefully referrals

concerns:

- chatgpt says its significantly less than m quoted
- could be spending my time applying for google to get to NY/London while i'm young. or travel?
- really stressed about doing things while i'm young need to figure that out

still want to just build it to have something "finished"
then can move
