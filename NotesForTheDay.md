4/3/25:
got connection working again, added bookmark
I tried adding my IP address, but that still didn't work?
had to add 0.0.0.0/0 (allow all traffic) for temporary 6 hours

done:
python3 -m venv venv
pip3 install flask
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
for future users: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
